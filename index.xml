      <description>Stephen Levy writes that the &amp;ldquo;true hackers&amp;rdquo; at MIT in the fifties and sixties were primarily identified by following a shared hacker ethic:
 Access to computers—and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative! All information should be free. Mistrust authority—promote decentralization. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to set this up for quite a while now, but never really got around to it. I was finally given some incentive when I started a class called Hackers in the Bazaar, which required a blog to post responses to class readings (those responses can be found here).
That said, I hope to use this blog for much more than just assigned posts.</description>

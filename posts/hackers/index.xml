      <description>The hardware hackers of 1970s California (what would ultimately become Silicon Valley) thought that it was vital to spread computing to the masses, rejecting the ivory tower of MIT&amp;rsquo;s AI lab. It was this attitude that eventually led to the creation of the first microcomputers—computers that could fit in your living room, not just in university labs or corporate offices. Computers like the Altair 8800 and the Apple II were inconceivable to the giants of computing: IBM, HP, and the like.</description>

      <description>Stephen Levy writes that the &amp;ldquo;true hackers&amp;rdquo; at MIT in the fifties and sixties were primarily identified by following a shared hacker ethic:
 Access to computers—and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative! All information should be free. Mistrust authority—promote decentralization. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.</description>
